#Objects and Functions Lab
This lab was fun in that I was able to easily answer every question I'm beginning to click with all of the topics being taught recently about objects and high order functions. Unlike alot of code I had written in the past, I feel like this was straight to the point programming, and didnt leave me feeling like there was a better way to solve the problems afterwards.
